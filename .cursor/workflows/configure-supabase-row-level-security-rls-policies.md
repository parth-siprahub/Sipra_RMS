description: Define secure database policies to protect user data
---

1. **Enable RLS**:
   - Always enable RLS on every table you create.
   ```sql
   alter table profiles enable row level security;
   ```

2. **Create "Select" Policy**:
   - Allow users to see only their own profile.
   ```sql
   create policy "Users can view own profile"
   on profiles for select
   to authenticated
   using ( auth.uid() = id );
   ```

3. **Create "Update" Policy**:
   - Allow users to update only their own profile.
   ```sql
   create policy "Users can update own profile"
   on profiles for update
   to authenticated
   using ( auth.uid() = id );
   ```

4. **Pro Tips**:
   - Use the `anon` role for public data (like blog posts).
   - Test your policies in the Supabase dashboard using the "Impersonate User" feature.
